Fun fact: A while back, my brother handed me a book called 'Python for Beginners.' As a proud Biology grad, I assumed it was a charming guide to snake handling. Imagine my shock when I finally peeked inside and found no snakes, just codes! Turns out, it's about programming, not pythons! Who knew? Swapping scales for syntax, I discovered programming is actually more enthralling than the reptiles I studied. A hilarious twist to my educational journey 😂
